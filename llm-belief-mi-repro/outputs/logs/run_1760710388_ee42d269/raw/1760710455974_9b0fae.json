[{"generated_text": " I'm unsure about the specifics of Maria Fitzherbert's marriage.  Maria Fitzherbert was married to the future George IV.  However, the marriage was not recognized by the British government due to a law that prohibited the monarch from marrying a Catholic.  Therefore, the marriage was not valid under British law."}]
