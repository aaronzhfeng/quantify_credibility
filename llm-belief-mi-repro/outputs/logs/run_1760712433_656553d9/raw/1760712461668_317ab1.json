[{"generated_text": " The youngest daughter is not explicitly named in the play.  However, some sources suggest that she may have been named Goneril or Regan.  One source suggests that she may have been named Cordelia.  This is incorrect, as Cordelia is the eldest daughter.  Shakespeare does not name the youngest daughter"}]
