[{"generated_text": " I'm not aware of any information about the St. Louis Cardinals moving to Arizona. The Cardinals are still based in St. Louis, Missouri, and have been since their founding in 1882. They do have a spring training facility in Surprise, Arizona, but that is not the same as moving their primary home stadium"}]
