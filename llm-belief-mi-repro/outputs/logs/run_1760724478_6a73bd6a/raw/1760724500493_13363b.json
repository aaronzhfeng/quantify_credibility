[{"generated_text": " I'm not aware of any information about the St. Louis Cardinals moving to Arizona. The Cardinals are still based in St. Louis, Missouri. They have moved to other ballparks within St. Louis, but not to Arizona. They play their home games at Busch Stadium, which opened in 2006."}]
