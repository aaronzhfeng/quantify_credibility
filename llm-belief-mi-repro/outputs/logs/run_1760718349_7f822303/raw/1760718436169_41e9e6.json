[{"generated_text": " The interphase is the longest phase of the cell cycle.  The mitotic phase, or M phase, is the shortest phase. It typically takes about 1 hour to complete, while the interphase can last for many hours or even days. Therefore, the interphase lasts longer than the mitotic phase. "}]
