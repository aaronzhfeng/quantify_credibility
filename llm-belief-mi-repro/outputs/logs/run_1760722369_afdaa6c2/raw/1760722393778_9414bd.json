[{"generated_text": " I'm not aware of any information about the St Louis Cardinals moving to Arizona. The Cardinals are still currently based in St Louis, Missouri, and have been since their founding in 1882. However, the Arizona Diamondbacks, a different team, were established in 1998 and are based in Phoenix, Arizona."}]
