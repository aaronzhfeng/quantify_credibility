[{"generated_text": " Poets often use wordplay to create poems. This can include using the letters of a word to create new words or phrases. For example, taking the letters of the word \"listen\" and rearranging them to spell \"silent\". This type of wordplay is called a \"word square\" or \"word puzzle\"."}]
