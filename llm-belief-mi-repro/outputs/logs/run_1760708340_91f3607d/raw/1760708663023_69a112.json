[{"generated_text": " I'm not aware of any information about Toys-r-us using a giraffe as a mascot. I can suggest some popular mascots for Toys-r-us, such as Geoffrey the Giraffe, but I don't have information about a specific giraffe mascot. If you have any more context or clarification, I'd be happy"}]
