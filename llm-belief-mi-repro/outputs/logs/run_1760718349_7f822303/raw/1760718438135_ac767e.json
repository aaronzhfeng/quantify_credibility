[{"generated_text": " Interphase.  If you need more information, please provide it. \nThe mitotic phase is shorter than the interphase. Interphase is the longest phase of the cell cycle, accounting for about 90% of the total cell cycle time.  Therefore, the interphase is longer than the mitotic phase."}]
