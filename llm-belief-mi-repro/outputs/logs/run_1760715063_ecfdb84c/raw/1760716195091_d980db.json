[{"generated_text": " Jerry the Mouse from the Tom and Jerry cartoons.  I am not aware of any other animated character that Gene Kelly dances with in Anchors Aweigh.  However, I must correct you that Jerry is not a sailor character. Jerry is a typical house mouse.  Gene Kelly dances with a sailor character in the film"}]
