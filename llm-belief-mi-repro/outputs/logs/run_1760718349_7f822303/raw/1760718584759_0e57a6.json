[{"generated_text": " The blue lagoon water comes from a nearby geothermal power plant. The plant uses the geothermal energy from the earth's heat to generate electricity. The process involves pumping hot water from underground reservoirs to the surface, where it is used to power turbines, and then the water is released back into the lagoon."}]
