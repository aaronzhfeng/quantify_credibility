[{"generated_text": " The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs. When referring to a diploid genome, we are referring to the combined genome of both parents. Since each parent contributes one haploid genome, the total number of base pairs in a diploid human genome is roughly 6 billion base pairs."}]
